## Quantum Gates

In the [Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing](https://the-singularity-research.github.io/linear_algebra_for_quantum_computing/) lectures, there was a lecture on quantum gates. Quantum gates are similar in spirit to classical logic gates used in classical computing. Quantum gates however are always represented by matrices. In particular they are represented by unitary matrices in the quantum circuit model of quantum computing. Quantum circuits are diagrams that represent algorithms which are composed of these quantum gates. 

## Quantum Circuit Diagrams

Quantum circuit diagrams are a visual, graphical representation of quantum algorithms. The usual graphical notation is called *staff notation* and looks very much like the musical staff that composers and musicians write music on.
